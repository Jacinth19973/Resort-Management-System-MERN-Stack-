. The system’s core functionality revolves around user convenience and operational efficiency—allowing customers to search resorts, make bookings, order food, manage payments through a virtual wallet, and generate invoices, while enabling administrators to oversee resort data, manage users, and track overall performance. 

      The application architecture follows the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to ensure scalability, modularity, and responsiveness. Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are used to illustrate process flows—such as user registration, authentication, resort listing, booking confirmation, staff assignment, food ordering, checkout, and PDF invoice generation—while Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) define structured relationships among entities like USER, RESORT, BOOKING, STAFF, FOOD, and INVOICE.

     The administrator dashboard provides intuitive tools for adding, updating, and deleting resorts, viewing user transactions, updating wallet balances, and analyzing booking statistics. The system employs JWT-based authentication and bcrypt hashing for secure user login and registration, ensuring strong data protection. Additionally, a chatbot module “Ask RMS Bot” has been integrated to guide users with booking-related FAQs, food menu queries, and general assistance.

     Comprehensive black box and white box testing validated all functional modules, including booking verification, payment deduction, and automated PDF invoice generation, ensuring a reliable, user-centric experience. The system enhances transparency in resort operations, simplifies administrative control, and delivers a professional and automated digital booking workflow. Future advancements include email notifications, AI-powered recommendation systems, and mobile app integration to improve accessibility and personalization.
